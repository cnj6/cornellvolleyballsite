    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Hello Big Red Fans! We are so glad you are interested in connecting with our NCAA Division I volleyball program. We compete in the Ivy Leauge conference. Last season we placed third in the Ivy League conference. The team ended with an 8-4 record in conference, and overall 17-6 record. We placed 3rd in the Ivy League. The team ranked first in opponent hitting percentages, opponent kills, opponent blocks, and opponent assists. The team was ranked second in hitting percentage, assists, digs, service aces, and kills in the Ivy League.</p>

    <p>Cornell is based in Ithaca, NY, and academics are a very important part of the volleyball program. We only recruit players with good GPA's and SAT/ACT scores, so make sure to keep focusing on your academics throughout your highschool career. As a member of the Ivy League, Cornell must adhere to strict recruiting rules most other NCAA Division I universities do not need to keep. One of the rules that suprises most people, is that we are unable to give athletic and academic scholarships at Cornell. However, many athletes do qualify for financial aid. Additionally, when you "commit," you are technically committing to apply early decision to Cornell. On our side, we are committing to reccommending you to admissions.</p>

    <p>Recruits, on this website you will find our contact information, details about our program, current positions being recruited, and our recruiting schedule. We hope this page brings you clarification and peace of mind throughout the recruiting process. Please reach out to us, preferably by email, and tell us about yourself. We hope to watch you play soon! Alumni, this website provides you with contact information, details about our current program, our game and event schedule, the team's community outreach, and information on how you can donate and support this team. We look forward to re-connecting with you! Please do not be shy, and reach out. The Big Red Family runs deep.</p>
