            <h3>Kids Clinics</h3>
            <p> After some of our home games, we host a free volleyball clinic for any children ages 5-14 who would like to learn and refine thier volleyball skills. We teach setting, passing, blocking, serving, and hitting. The team is also more than happy to sign your posters, volleyballs, t-shirts, etc. afterwards. It is a great opportunity to get children interested in and excited about volleyball. Stay posted for the dates!</p>

            <h3>Adopt a Family</h3>
            <p>We also participate in Adopt a Family during the holiday season. The team "adopts a family" that may not be able to afford a Christman dinner or presents for thier children. The team helps provide for them by buying presents for specific genders and age ranges they are provided with. We, along with other varsity teams, have participated in this charity event for the past 7 years.</p>

            <h3>Hoops for Hope</h3>
            <p>Hoops for Hope is a charity 4v4 basketball tournament that the Cornell Volleyball team has put on for the past 3 years to raise money for pediatric cancer for the V Foundation. In the past we have raised over $5,000. Please join us this year in our annual fundraiser. You can be involved by forming a team, coming to support, or donating. Come shoot some hoops, have some fun, and help some kids.</p>
